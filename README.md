# file metadata

Part of the Free Code Camp Backend certification API [File Metadata microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/file-metadata-microservice) project.

The user stories are:

   1.  I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.
   2.  When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response
   
    

You can find the application hosted on Heroku [here](https://bexis-file-metadata.herokuapp.com/).
